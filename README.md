# CPP-Lisp

Screwing around with C++ to learn more about lisp, refresh on C++, and make a lisp interpreter.
Specifically, this is a Scheme interpreter (a minimalist dialect of lisp).

**I am not a C++ programmer, you have been warned.**
After this little project I can't say I'll be using C++ anytime soon.
I am really not a fan of it anymore.


## Stretch Goals
- [ ] Vectors
- [ ] Hash Maps
